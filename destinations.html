                        just over 350 years. Gaining recognition when, in 1639, Francis Day and Andrew Cogan, agents of
                        the English East India Company, acquired a strip of land, called Chennapatnam on lease from the
                        Vijayanagar King. Fort St. George that serves as the Government Secretariat today, was built to

                        potpourri of old and new. From banjara gypsies in swinging skirts and silver ornaments to
                        black-veiled burqa - swathed women dressed in churidars or jeans, Hyderabad is an amalgamation
                        of historic tradition and modernization at the same time.</p>

                        cultural and spiritual significance for its visitors. It is believed that when Raibhya Rishi
                        undertook rigorous penance, God appeared in the form of "Hrishikesh" and henceforth this area
                        came to be known as Rishikesh. It is the starting point for the Hindu Char Dham pilgrimage,
